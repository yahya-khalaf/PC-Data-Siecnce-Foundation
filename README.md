# Data Science Foundation Course - Hands-On Activities

Welcome to the **Data Science Foundation Course - Hands-On Activities** repository! This repository contains the hands-on activities and practical exercises I developed as part of the **Data Science Foundation Course**. These activities are designed to complement the theoretical content of the course and provide learners with practical experience in key data science concepts.

## **About the Course**
The **Data Science Foundation Course** is designed to introduce learners to the fundamental concepts of data science, including machine learning, data analytics, visualization, and data governance. My role in this course was to create **hands-on activities** that reinforce the theoretical concepts and help learners apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized into folders based on the course modules and topics. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and additional resources for the hands-on activities. Hereâ€™s an overview of the structure:
